# TODO List for Services Form WhatsApp Button Conversion and About Page Layout

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Convert the WhatsApp appointment booking link to a button in services.html
- [x] Update CSS to position the button at the bottom left corner of the .customer-services section
- [x] Wrap location-map and contact-us sections in a container div in about.html
- [x] Update CSS to display map and contact form side by side using flexbox

## Summary
- The WhatsApp appointment booking link has been successfully converted to a button positioned at the bottom left corner of the services form. The button uses an onclick event to open WhatsApp in a new tab, and the CSS positions it absolutely within the .customer-services section.
- The contact form on the about page is now positioned next to the map in a side-by-side layout using flexbox, with responsive design for smaller screens.
